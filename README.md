# XmasBusylight
This is a dumb demonstration of using the [Phenom Busylight UC SDK](http://www.plenom.com/support/develop/). It just makes your Busylight flash in random colors and plays a christmas sound loop. Hooray!

# Requirements
You just need to execute the program and annoy your office collegaues by mounting the Busylight on a fancy hat.

# Demonstration
